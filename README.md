## Algorithm Overviews

### 1. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
- **Type:** Population-based metaheuristic
- **Mechanism:** Simulates swarm behavior where particles (potential solutions) move toward the best-known positions.

#### Strengths:
- Effective in continuous spaces
- Handles non-linear, non-convex environments
- Produces smooth, optimized paths

#### Limitations:
- No collision guarantee (depends on cost function)
- May get stuck in local optima

**Best for:** Environments requiring smooth trajectories (e.g., drone path planning).

---

### 2. Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT)
- **Type:** Sampling-based exploration
- **Mechanism:** Incrementally builds a tree by randomly sampling points and connecting them via collision-free paths.

#### Strengths:
- Works well in high-dimensional spaces
- Probabilistically complete (guaranteed to find a path if one exists, given enough time)
- No need for explicit obstacle modeling

#### Limitations:
- Paths may be suboptimal
- Jerky, non-smooth trajectories

**Best for:** Robotic arms, dynamic environments, and 3D spaces.

---

### 3. A* (A-Star)
- **Type:** Heuristic-guided graph search
- **Mechanism:** Uses a cost function \( f(n) = g(n) + h(n) \) to explore the most promising nodes first.

#### Strengths:
- Guarantees optimality (with admissible heuristic)
- Computationally efficient for grid-based maps

#### Limitations:
- Struggles in high-dimensional spaces
- Requires discretization (grid-based)

**Best for:** Warehouse robots, video game AI, and structured 2D/3D environments.

---

## Why Compare These Algorithms?

### Performance in Different Environments
- **Structured (e.g., warehouses):** A* dominates due to optimality.
- **Unstructured (e.g., outdoor drones):** RRT or PSO may be better.

### Real-Time vs. Offline Planning
- **A*** is fast for precomputed grids.
- **RRT** adapts better to dynamic changes.
- **PSO** is slower but optimizes smoother paths.

### Optimality vs. Feasibility Trade-off
- **A*** guarantees the shortest path.
- **RRT** finds feasible paths quickly.
- **PSO** optimizes for smoothness rather than strict minimal distance.

## Conclusion
The choice between PSO, RRT, and A* depends on the applicationâ€™s requirements:

- **Use A*** for grid-based, optimal pathfinding (e.g., warehouse robots).
- **Use RRT** for high-dimensional, dynamic environments (e.g., robotic arms).
- **Use PSO** when path smoothness is critical (e.g., drone navigation).
